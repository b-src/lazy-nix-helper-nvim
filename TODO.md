# TODO

## Core Functionality

- [x] naive implementation of nix store plugin discovery
- [ ] make plugin discovery work in a non-nixos environment with nix installed
- [x] get nix store plugin path given a plugin name

## Configuration

- [x] instructions to bootstrap lazy-nix-helper
- [x] instructions for updating existing plugin config
- [ ] come up with a better way to provide lazy-nix-helper's own nix store path than manually supplying it

## Installation

- [ ] package plugin and get it merged to nixpkgs
